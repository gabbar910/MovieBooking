# Code Review Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the automated and manual code review process for this project to ensure code quality, maintainability, and security.

## Automated Code Review Process

### Pre-commit Hooks

- **ESLint**: Automatically fixes linting issues
- **Prettier**: Formats code according to project standards
- **Type checking**: Validates TypeScript types

### CI/CD Pipeline

- **Multi-node testing**: Tests on Node.js 18.x and 20.x
- **Security audit**: Checks for known vulnerabilities
- **Dependency review**: Analyzes new dependencies for security issues
- **Build verification**: Ensures the project builds successfully

## Code Quality Standards

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for new files when possible
- Follow ESLint rules configured in `eslint.config.js`
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React hooks rules (exhaustive-deps)
- Implement proper prop types or TypeScript interfaces
- Keep components small and focused on single responsibility

### File Organization

- Group related files in appropriate directories
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Keep imports organized (external, internal, relative)

## Manual Review Checklist

### Functionality

- [ ] Code solves the intended problem
- [ ] Edge cases are handled appropriately
- [ ] Error handling is implemented where needed
- [ ] Performance considerations are addressed

### Code Quality

- [ ] Code is readable and well-documented
- [ ] No code duplication
- [ ] Functions are small and focused
- [ ] Consistent coding style throughout

### Security

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data
- [ ] Input validation is implemented
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date and secure
- [ ] No potential XSS or injection vulnerabilities

### Testing

- [ ] Unit tests cover new functionality
- [ ] Integration tests for complex features
- [ ] Manual testing performed
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**: All automated checks must pass before review
2. **Self Review**: Author performs self-review using this checklist
3. **Peer Review**: At least one team member reviews the code
4. **Testing**: Manual testing of new features
5. **Approval**: Code is approved and merged

## Tools and Integrations

### Local Development

- ESLint with TypeScript support
- Prettier for code formatting
- Husky for Git hooks
- lint-staged for pre-commit checks

### CI/CD

- GitHub Actions for automated testing
- Dependency review for security
- Code coverage reporting
- Build verification

## Best Practices

### Commit Messages

- Use conventional commit format
- Be descriptive and concise
- Reference issue numbers when applicable

### Pull Requests

- Keep PRs small and focused
- Provide clear description of changes
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- Link to related issues

### Code Comments

- Explain "why" not "what"
- Update comments when code changes
- Remove outdated comments
- Use JSDoc for function documentation

## Enforcement

- Pre-commit hooks prevent commits that don't meet standards
- CI/CD pipeline blocks merges if checks fail
- Manual review is required for all pull requests
- Regular code quality audits and improvements
